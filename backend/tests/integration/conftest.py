"""Pytest fixtures for the backend API suite.

The model relies on Postgres-specific features (the ``card_ticket_seq`` sequence,
the ``'KAN-' || nextval(...)`` server default, and a CHECK constraint), so tests
run against a real Postgres — not SQLite. Rather than depend on a manually-managed
database, pytest starts an ephemeral Postgres via **testcontainers** and tears it
down at the end of the session, so the suite is fully self-contained (and CI-ready).
Requires a running Docker daemon.

Flow: start container → point DATABASE_URL at it → ``alembic upgrade head`` (which
also exercises the migrations) → reset tables + sequences between tests for
deterministic ticket numbers.

    App modules build the SQLAlchemy engines from ``DATABASE_URL`` **at import
    time**. If an integration test imports one at *module top level*, that import
    runs during pytest **collection** — before the session ``_database`` fixture
    repoints ``DATABASE_URL`` at the throwaway Postgres — so the engines bind to
    the default ``localhost:5432`` URL. On a dev box with a local Postgres up that
    silently "passes" (against the wrong DB); in CI, with nothing on 5432, every
    integration test errors with "connection refused".

    So: **all app imports must live inside test/fixture bodies**, never at module
    top (see DEVELOPER-WORKFLOWS.md §1a). ``app.db`` is the module that reads
    ``DATABASE_URL`` and builds the engines; every other app module pulls it in
    transitively, so checking it here catches them all. This fires at collection —
    Docker-free — so ``pytest --collect-only`` in the pre-push hook catches it
    before a push, deterministically, whether or not a local DB is running.
