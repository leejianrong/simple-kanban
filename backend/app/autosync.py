"""Auto-sync: map GitHub webhook events onto board card updates (KAN-43).

The webhook receiver (:mod:`app.routers.webhooks`, KAN-42) verifies GitHub's HMAC
signature and dispatches per event; this module turns those events into board
side effects so the board reflects real git/CI state automatically:

- ``pull_request`` ``opened`` / ``reopened`` → attach the PR URL as a card
  work-link (``CardLink``), idempotent by URL.
- ``check_suite`` / ``status`` → post a card comment (``CardComment``) summarising
  the CI result (state / status / conclusion).
- ``pull_request`` ``closed`` with ``merged == true`` → move the card to ``done``
  — but **only** if the board additionally opted into ``autosync_advance_to_done``.

**Opt-out is the gate (per-board, default OFF).** Every action first resolves the
target card's :class:`~app.models.Board` and does nothing unless
``board.autosync_enabled`` is true — a board owner who prefers to move cards by
hand simply leaves the toggle off. Moving to ``done`` on merge is doubly gated by
``autosync_advance_to_done`` so 'done' stays a human-in-the-loop decision.

These writes act as **the system**, not a logged-in user: the webhook is
authenticated by the HMAC signature, so — unlike the rest of ``/api/v1`` — this
path deliberately does NOT go through ``get_principal`` / ``authorize_board``
(ADR 0013). The per-board opt-in flag is the authorization. We open our own sync
session (:data:`app.db.SessionLocal`) rather than depending on ``get_db`` for the
same reason. To keep the DB-free unit tests DB-free, each entry point parses the
card ticket **before** touching the database and no-ops (no session opened) when a
payload carries no ``KAN-<n>``.
