"""Epics endpoints (ADR 0009; **owner-gated in V8, ADR 0013**).

Epics are a per-board grouping a story can belong to — one board owns many epics,
one epic groups many stories (all on that board). Created and read in a separate UI
surface, not on the kanban board. Full CRUD, mirroring the flat structure of the
cards router (API-first, ADR 0005). Mounted by ``main.py`` under ``/api/v1``:

- GET    /epics       — list the caller's epics (optionally scoped to one board)
- POST   /epics       — create an epic (EPIC-<n> assigned by the DB)
- GET    /epics/{id}  — read one epic
- PATCH  /epics/{id}  — edit fields (name/description)
- DELETE /epics/{id}  — soft-delete (tombstone, KAN-19); child stories keep epic_id
- GET    /epics/trash — list this board's soft-deleted epics (KAN-20)
- POST   /epics/{id}/restore — un-tombstone a soft-deleted epic; its stories re-link (KAN-20)
- DELETE /epics/{id}/purge — permanently hard-delete a soft-deleted epic (KAN-20)

**Authorization (V8):** every route requires a principal (`401` otherwise) and
that the principal own the epic's board (`403`); the list is scoped to the caller's
boards. See :mod:`app.authz`.
