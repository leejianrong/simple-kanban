"""Cards endpoints (BREADBOARD §6, P4; **owner-gated in V8, ADR 0013**).

Mounted by ``main.py`` under ``/api/v1`` (e.g. ``/api/v1/cards``):

- GET    /cards         — list/query cards (filter + keyset pagination; see list_cards)
- POST   /cards         — create a card (appended to the end of its column)
- GET    /cards/{id}    — read one card
- PATCH  /cards/{id}    — edit fields (title/description/story_points/assignee)
- DELETE /cards/{id}    — soft-delete (tombstone; excluded from default reads, KAN-19)
- POST   /cards/{id}/move — move/reorder a card (column change + reorder within column)
- GET    /cards/trash   — list this board's soft-deleted cards (KAN-20)
- POST   /cards/{id}/restore — un-tombstone a soft-deleted card, re-appending it (KAN-20)
- DELETE /cards/{id}/purge — permanently hard-delete a soft-deleted card (KAN-20)

**Authorization (V8):** every route requires a principal (`401` otherwise) and
that the principal own the card's board (`403`); the list is scoped to the caller's
boards. See :mod:`app.authz`.

    **Owner-scoped (V8):** results are limited to boards the caller owns. A
    ``board_id`` naming a board you don't own is a ``403`` (not a silently-empty
    list).

    Filters (all optional, AND-ed): ``board_id`` (cards on that board — the SPA
    always sends it to scope the view; omitted → all *your* boards); ``column``;
    ``epic_id`` (stories linked to that epic); ``updated_since`` (an ISO-8601
    timestamp — cards whose ``updated_at`` is at or after it, **inclusive**, the
    "changed since" feed for polling agents); ``blocked`` (KAN-29 ready/blocked
    signal — ``blocked=true`` returns only cards with ≥1 blocker not yet ``done``;
    ``blocked=false`` returns the **actionable/ready** cards, i.e. no blockers or
    all blockers done). The ``blocked`` field is on every card in the response
    regardless of this filter. It is a SQL ``EXISTS`` predicate, so it AND-s with
    the other filters and keyset pagination stays exact.

    Card-field filters (M5 V11, KAN-244): ``priority`` (exact match on the enum);
    ``label`` (a label id — cards carrying that label); ``due_before`` (an ISO-8601
    timestamp — cards with a ``due_date`` strictly before it; null due dates are
    excluded); ``overdue`` (``true`` → cards past their ``due_date`` and not yet
    ``done``; ``false`` → the null-safe complement).

    Handoff filter (M5 V13, KAN-246): ``needs_human`` (``true`` → cards an agent
    flagged for a human via ``POST /cards/{id}/needs-human``; ``false`` → the rest).

    Query grammar (M5 V14, KAN-247): ``assignee`` (exact match) joins the filter
    set above, and ``sort`` re-orders the result — a comma-separated list of keys
    with an optional ``-`` prefix for descending (e.g. ``sort=priority``,
    ``sort=-due_date``, ``sort=-priority,position``). ``priority`` sorts by rank
    (none→urgent), NULLs sink either way, and ``id`` is the stable tiebreaker. Valid
    sort fields: ``position``, ``priority``, ``due_date``, ``created_at``,
    ``updated_at``, ``story_points``, ``assignee``, ``title``, ``column``, ``id``
    (an unknown one is a ``422``). These same keys are the structured JSON grammar a
    **saved view** stores (``/boards/{id}/views``), so a view's query replays here.

    Full-text search (M5 V15, KAN-248): ``q`` (a free-text query) narrows the result
    to cards whose ``title``/``description`` match ``websearch_to_tsquery('english',
    q)`` (so ``foo bar`` = both terms, ``"foo bar"`` = the phrase, ``foo -bar`` =
    exclude). It AND-s with every filter above and honours board access exactly like
    the rest. **Ordering precedence:** an explicit ``sort`` always wins; otherwise a
    non-empty ``q`` ranks by relevance (``ts_rank`` best-first, a **title** hit above
    a description-only hit via the vector's A/B weighting), with ``id`` the stable
    tiebreaker. An empty/whitespace-only (or absent) ``q`` is a no-op — the ordering
    and result set are unchanged.

    Pagination is keyset over ``(updated_at, id)`` — the **default** ordering: pass
    ``limit`` to cap the page; when a full page is returned the next page's opaque
    cursor rides the ``X-Next-Cursor`` response header (absent on the last page).
    Echo it back as ``cursor`` for the next request. A custom ``sort`` — or relevance
    ranking from a non-empty ``q`` — overrides that order, so it is **incompatible
    with ``cursor``** (``422`` if combined) and emits no cursor; ``limit`` then just
    caps a top-N by that order. The body stays a bare ``CardRead[]`` so the SPA is
    unaffected; it re-sorts by ``position`` per column client-side.

# Human/agent-authored intentional notes (a decision, a handoff, "why this is
# blocked") — **distinct from Epic 4's SYSTEM activity log** (KAN-17..20, not yet
# built), which will record machine-generated audit events. No activity-log
# machinery here. Comments are a thread, so — unlike KAN-32's small ``links`` array
# which is inlined on every card read — they get a dedicated list endpoint rather
# than being serialized onto CardRead (a card could accumulate many).
